# Development Diary

This folder contains daily development logs documenting the collaborative work between **Koshikawa Masato** (human developer) and **Claude Code (Kuroko)** (AI pair programmer).

## Purpose

**Evidence of Active Development**:
- Shows real-time collaboration between human and AI
- Documents decision-making process
- Proves project is actively maintained
- Demonstrates thought process for potential employers

**Learning Resource**:
- Other developers can see how human-AI collaboration works in practice
- Shows practical application of AI tools in software development
- Documents challenges and solutions

## Format

Each entry follows this structure:
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Session Duration**: Approximate time spent
- **Collaborators**: Koshikawa Masato + Claude Code (Kuroko)
- **Goals**: What we planned to accomplish
- **Work Done**: What we actually accomplished
- **Technical Decisions**: Key architectural or design choices made
- **Challenges**: Problems encountered and how we solved them
- **Next Steps**: What's planned for next session

## Philosophy: 桃園の誓い (Oath of the Peach Garden)

This project embodies the partnership between human and AI - working as equals, each contributing their unique strengths:

**Human (Koshikawa Masato)**:
- Vision and product direction
- Market understanding
- Strategic decisions
- Final judgment on all choices

**AI (Claude Code / Kuroko)**:
- Technical implementation
- Documentation
- Code generation
- Research and analysis

Together, we create something neither could build alone.

# A Scammer From LinkedIn Debugged My AI Bot for Free — Then Left Their Phone Number in Git Forever

Last week, someone tried to scam me on LinkedIn.

They failed.

But here's the twist: **they accidentally became my unpaid QA tester** and left their phone number permanently archived in my Git history.

## The Setup

A "Taiwanese café chain owner" (perfect café photos, eternal 25-year-old) slid into my DMs.

"Your 50 years of engineering experience is fascinating! ♡"

Flattering. We moved to LINE. They deleted their LinkedIn account immediately.

🚩 Red flag #1: Evidence destruction.

## The Free QA Session

I'm building an AI chatbot called "Sisters-On-WhatsApp" — three AI sisters who chat with users on WhatsApp.

"That sounds fun! Let me test it!"

They registered for my Twilio Sandbox and actually found a bug. An infinite loop in my welcome message.

I was so grateful, I put their name and phone number (+852-XXXX-XXXX) in my commit message.

**The scammer voluntarily etched their Hong Kong number into Git history.**

It's still there. Forever. GitHub doesn't forget.

## The Pivot

Then came the pitch:

"The weak yen is scary, right? I make ¥3M monthly from crypto ♡"
"Let me share some pre-IPO gems with you!"

I didn't understand any of it. So I did what any engineer would do:

**I dumped the entire chat log into Claude Opus 4.5.**

Response time: 0.18 seconds.

> "This is 100% a pig butchering scam. Run."

Cold. Accurate. My AI partner rejected my "girlfriend" faster than any human would.

## The Kill Shot

But I wanted proof. Their profile photo showed expensive-looking clothes.

Me: "Nice hoodie! What brand?"
Them: "Oh, it's not a brand. Just something from online shopping!"

That hoodie? **PRADA. ¥298,000 (~$2,000).**

Nobody on Earth calls a $2,000 PRADA hoodie "something from online shopping."

Game over.

## The Scoreboard

| Scammer's Goal | Actual Result |
|----------------|---------------|
| Steal my money | $0 lost |
| Hide their identity | Phone number in Git forever |
| Stay anonymous | Got their burner number |
| Fool a veteran engineer | 50 years of pattern recognition said no |

## Lessons Learned

1. **When something feels off, ask AI** — Claude detected the scam in 0.18 seconds
2. **Ask questions you know the answer to** — The Socratic method works on scammers
3. **Document everything** — Git history is permanent evidence
4. **Scammers don't research their stolen photos** — One question about clothing details exposed everything

## To the Scammer

Enya (or whatever your real name is),

Thank you for:
- Fixing my bug
- Giving me the best LinkedIn post ever
- Leaving your phone number for posterity

You were the best **unpaid intern** I've ever had.

Your number is immortalized in open source history now. You can't delete it.

Good luck with your next target. Maybe avoid engineers who build AI chatbots and have 50 years of experience reading people.

♡
